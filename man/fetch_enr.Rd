\title{Fetch Vermont enrollment data}
\usage{
fetch_enr(end_year, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year end. Year is the end of the academic year - eg 2023-24
school year is year '2024'. Valid values are 2004-2025 (2003-04 through 2024-25
school years). Data is collected on October 1 of each school year.}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns data in long (tidy) format with subgroup
column. If FALSE, returns wide format.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from Vermont AOE.}
}
\value{
Data frame with enrollment data. Wide format includes columns for
district_id, campus_id, names, and enrollment counts by grade.
Tidy format pivots these counts into subgroup and grade_level columns.
}
\description{
Downloads and processes enrollment data from the Vermont Agency of Education
via the Vermont Education Dashboard (VED).
}
\note{
The 2017-18 (end_year = 2018) data appears to have quality issues in the
source file, with significantly lower enrollment than expected.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get 2024 enrollment data (2023-24 school year)
enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024)

# Get wide format
enr_wide <- fetch_enr(2024, tidy = FALSE)

# Force fresh download (ignore cache)
enr_fresh <- fetch_enr(2024, use_cache = FALSE)

# Get state-level totals
state_total <- enr_2024 |>
  dplyr::filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")
}
